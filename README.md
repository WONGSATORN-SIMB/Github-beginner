## Reflection 

* Steps & experience

  1. Firstly, I sign up for GitHub and create a new repository for practice, which I name GitHub-beginner 
  2. Then, I clone it locally on my computer, and my problem arises because I cannot find my repository folder. At first, I thought it was misspelled, but after several tries, it didn't work out, so I  guess it was that I had not installed GitHub yet, and then my problem was solved
  3. After that, I find my local repository folder and begin using markdown syntax to edit, consisting of A main heading, sub heading, a Bulleted list, a numbered list, A sample code, and create a new text file called "Practice.txt" and tell about my GitHub experience.
  4. Next, stage and commit. I bypass this quickly with no problem by using these steps 
	- I navigate the command to my repo folder 
  	- then I type git status to check what these two are listed as
	- after that, I type git add to prepare my files for commit
 	- then I commit and stage my changes by git commit -m "......."
  5. Then, I try to push my local repository to GitHub, and my problem arises again because after I pushed, My file did not show on repo pages on GitHub and after several try and i came to finished it by:
	- Recheck if the navigation to my local repo is correct, and it is partly correct because I missed a few brackets, then i fixed it and pushed again 
	- after pushing, it shows that I need to authorize and identify myself first by (git config --global user.email "you@example.com"),
  (git config --global user. name "Your Name") 
	- Lastly, after verifying myself and pushing one last time, my files are now visible in my repo pages on GitHub.
