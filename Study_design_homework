Discussion Prompts: Designing a Study for a Novel Gene Variant

[Scenario:] Imagine a large-scale Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) has identified a novel gene variant, VAR-X. 
Preliminary data suggest VAR-X is significantly associated with accelerated cognitive decline in patients already 
diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. As a team of epidemiologists and bioinformaticians, your group has been tasked with designing the definitive 
study to validate this association and understand its clinical impact.

[Question 1:] The Foundational Design Choice
Propose two distinct epidemiological study designs that could rigorously test the hypothesis that VAR-X 
is associated with accelerated cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients. For this discussion:

Part A: Choose one observational design (e.g., prospective cohort, retrospective cohort, or case-control) and one experimental design 
(e.g., a hypothetical randomized controlled trial for a therapeutic targeting the VAR-X pathway).
      - observational design: Prospective cohort 
      - Experimental design: Randomized controlled trial or RCT

Part B: For each design, define your specific study population, primary exposure, and primary outcome measure.
      - Observational design: Prospective cohort
            Study population: 65+ years patients who are already diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
            Primary exposure: presence of the VAR-X allele.
            Primary outcome: The rate of cognitive decline every 6 months over a 3-5 year follow-up period 
      - Experimental design: Randomized controlled trial or RCT
            Study population: 65+ years patients who are already diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
            Primary exposure: treatment group vs placebo group.
            Primary outcome: The change in cognitive function after 12-18 months of treatment, measured by MMSE scores

Part C: Debate and justify which design would provide the strongest evidence for causality. 
What are the primary trade-offs between the two in terms of ethics, cost, feasibility, and time?
      - Observational design: Prospective cohort
            Ethics: lower risk, as it involves only observation and analysis.
            Cost: fairly moderate cost, the cost needed to keep the follow-up process.
            Feasibility: Could turn the ideal into reality as long as the conditions are met.
            Time: Much longer time, requires more consistency
            Causality: moderately, but residual confounding is always a risk
      - Experimental design: Randomized controlled trial or RCT
            Ethics: High risk, as it involves direct interaction with the patients and the safety of the said drug.
            Cost: Fairly High cost, requires producing the new drug, the approval from FDA.
            Feasibility: lower, requires the safety of the drug before the test, which costs a lot of money and time
            Time: if including the drug development process, it might take 10+ years
            Causality: Provide strong causality as the RCT ensures that the only difference is. between the two groups is only the drug, 
                       to minimize bias and confounding factors



[Question 2:] Anticipating and Mitigating Bias
Focusing on the observational study design you proposed in Question 1, 
Critically evaluate the potential threats to your study's validity.

Part A: Identify and explain the two most likely and impactful sources of bias 
(e.g., selection bias, information bias/misclassification, confounding).
       - Information bias: If the patient is lost to follow-up, whether the cause is, it would affect the result greatly
       - Confounding factor: ApoE allele, as it is the accelerator of AZ patients already, if combined with VAR-X, 
                            The rate of Cognitive decline could be from this said allele instead 


Part B: Propose specific, concrete strategies you would implement during the study design and data analysis phases 
to minimize the impact of these biases and any key confounders (e.g., age, disease severity at baseline, co-morbidities).
      - Information bias: keeping the patient interested, remote assessment.
      - Confounding factor: Analyze the data separately for ApoEÏµ4 carriers and non-carriers


Question 3: The Bioinformatics & Big Data Perspective
Now, let's re-examine this research question through the lens of medical bioinformatics.

Part A: How could you leverage existing large-scale resources, such as a national biobank or a federated network of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), 
to conduct a large-scale retrospective cohort study?
      - Search for the patient who was documented with Alzheimer's disease, who also had their genetic testing done to determine the presence of VAR-X status
      - Needed a large sample size across the population, hospital system, to increase statistical power

Part B: Compare and contrast the internal and external validity of this "big data" approach versus a traditional, prospectively recruited cohort. 
What do you gain in terms of statistical power and generalizability, and what new challenges related to data quality and phenotype accuracy do you face?
      - Big date retro. cohort
            Internal validity: Lower. Data was collected for clinical, not for research purposes.
            External validity: Higher. A larger sample size across the world reflects a  true association with Alzheimer's
            Statistical power: providing high statistical power to detect small effect sizes
            New challenges: Data Quality, the gene data might not be presented in every patient

      - Traditional pro. cohort
            Internal validity: Higher. Data is collected under a strict, standardized protocol.
            External validity: Lower. The population is highly selected, less representative.  
            Statistical power: Limited. Due to the high cost and labor of recruitment and follow-up.
            New challenges:  Keeping patients engaged, very expensive and long-duration study.
